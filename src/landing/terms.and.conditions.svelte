            <h2>Welcome to Octopus</h2>

            <p>Thank you for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Human Dialog S.A. (“Human Dialog”). By using our Octopus Services, you accept these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES.</p>

            <h2>Use of our Services</h2>

            <p>You must comply with all rules made available through the Services. You must not abuse our Services, such as tampering with them or attempting to access them in any way other than through the interface, provided API and instructions we provide. You may only use our Services in accordance with the law, including applicable export and re-export control laws. We may suspend or terminate our Services if you do not comply with our terms or policies, or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
            <p>Your use of our Services does not give you any intellectual property rights in them or in the content you access. You may not use the content of our Services unless you have obtained permission to do so from the owner of the content or it is permitted by law. These Terms and Conditions do not grant you the right to use any trademarks or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure or alter any legal notices displayed on or with our Services.</p>
            <p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages and other information. You may opt out of some of these communications.</p>
            <p>Most of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you or prevents you from complying with traffic laws or safety rules.</p>

            <h2>Your Octopus Account</h2>
            <p>You may need an ObjectReef account to use the Octopus Services. To protect your account, you must keep your password confidential. You are responsible for actions taken on or through your account. Try not to use your account password in third-party applications.</p>
            
            <h2>Privacy and copyright protection</h2>
            <p>The Octopus Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal information and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Octopus may use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.</p>
            
            <h2>Your content in our Services</h2>
            <p>Some of our Services allow you to create, upload, save, send or receive content. You retain the intellectual property rights that you own with respect to that content. In short, what belongs to you remains yours.</p>

            <h2>Software in our Services</h2>
            <p>When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, that software may automatically update on your device when a new version or feature becomes available. Some Services may allow you to customize automatic update settings.</p>
            <p>Human Dialog grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided as part of the Octopus Services. This license is intended to enable you to use the Octopus Services in accordance with these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or rent any part of our Services. </p>

            <h2>Modification and termination of our Services</h2>
            <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of the Service.</p>
            <p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don't promise about our Services. </p>
            <p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER HUMAN DIALOG NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES.</p>

            <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.</p>
            
            <h2>Limits on Liability</h2>
            <p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. However, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS".</p>
            <p>WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHEN PROBLEMS MAY OCCUR WITH OUR SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, INFORMATION OR DATA, OR FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR HUMAN DIALOG PRODUCTS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU USE AND/OR PURCHASE THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
            
            <h2>Business Uses of Our Services</h2>
            <p>If you use our Services on behalf of a company, that company accepts these terms and conditions. It will indemnify and hold Human Dialog and its affiliates, officers, agents and employees harmless from any claim, suit or action arising out of or related to your use of the Services or violation of these terms and conditions, including any liability or expense arising out of claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees.</p>
            
            <h2>About These Terms</h2>
            <p>These terms and conditions govern the relationship between Human Dialog and the user with respect to the use of Octopus services. They do not create any third-party beneficiary rights. If you do not comply with these terms and conditions and we do not act immediately, this does not mean that we give up any rights we may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a condition is not enforceable, no other conditions will be affected.</p>
